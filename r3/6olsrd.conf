# Olsrd plugins to load
# This must be the absolute path to the file

# - Try the paths in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
#   environment variable.
# - The list of libraries cached in /etc/ld.so.cache
# - /lib, followed by /usr/lib

# Interfaces and their rules
# Omitted options will be set to the

    # This polling can be disabled pr. NIC by setting

    # Ip6AddrType		site-local

    # IPv6 multicast address to use when
    # using site-local addresses.

    # Ip6MulticastSite		ff05::11

    # IPv6 multicast address to use when

    # When multiple links exist between hosts
    # the weight of interface is used to determine
    # the link to use. Normally the weight is
    # automatically calculated by olsrd based
    # on the characteristics of the interface,
    # but here you can specify a fixed value.
    # Olsrd will choose links with the lowest value.
    # Note: Interface weight is used only if the 
    # olsrd_rfc RFC mode plugin is loaded
    # Weight 0


    # If a certain route should be preferred 
    # or ignored by the mesh, the Link Quality 
    # value of a node can be multiplied with a factor 
    # entered here. In the example the route 
    # using 192.168.0.1 would rather be ignored.
    # A multiplier of 0.5 will result in a small
    # (bad) LinkQuality value and a high (bad)
    # ETX value.
    # Note: LQ Multiplier is used only if a 
    # olsrd_etx* non-RFC mode plugin is loaded

    # LinkQualityMult 192.168.0.1 0.5

    # This multiplier applies to all other nodes 
    # LinkQualityMult default 0.8
